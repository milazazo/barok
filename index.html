        <p><b>23/10:</b> i'll post the update here since i want to lock my account soon.</p>
        <p>currently, we're just planning to do the <b>comic anthology</b>, not the illustration artbook. it's just going to be run by two people and i'm managing finances myself, so i want to keep it small so i can afford to pay for contributor copy/shipping costs out of pocket. merch-wise, we'll just do stickers and prints. the other person is only handling shipping. i don't know if i'll bother finding someone else for graphics yet.</p>
        <p>so i can currently confirm there'll be around <b>10 B/W comic artists</b> (open application) and <b>3 full-color illustrators</b> (invite only). still unsure about writers for now.</p>
        <p>there's also a possibility it'll be centered around the van zieks family rather than london as a whole... we'll see! it's not until mid-2024 anyway. will i still be into DGS by then? i'm feeling really depressed about physical objects lately, so maybe i won't bother after all.</p>
